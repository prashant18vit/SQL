database, manipulate data, reporting/ representation of data._

# SQL:

***SQL is a standard language for dealing with relational databases which can
be used to create, read, update and delete database records.***


# Relational Database:
_A relational database is a type of database that stores data and provides access points to data that are related to one another_

*using ***"keys"*** such as ***"primary key"** **"secondary key"*** ***"Candidate key"*** these provide relation between one column of the table to another column of the table*

## SQL query

```

1. SELECT:- Depict data from the server and show it to us.
2. \* :- All / show everything that is present.
3. data1 :- DB Name.
4. WHERE age < 20 :- Condition.

# Application of SQL.

* **DDL:-** *SQL is used as **Data Definition Language** **(DDL)** meaning you can independently create a database, define its structure, use it and then discard it when we are done with it.*

* **DML:-** *SQL is used as **Data Manipulation Language** **(DML)** meaning you can use it to maintain an existing database 1.changing, 2.Updating, 3.deleting, etc.*

* **DCL:-** *SQL is used as **Data Control Language** **(DCL)** which specifies how you can protect your database against corruption and misuse.*

* **client/server language :-** *SQL is used as **client/ server language** to connect front-end with back-end thus supporting the client/server architecture .*

* **Three tier Architecture :-** *SQL is used as **Three tier architecture**  of a client, an application server and a database which defines the internet archtecuter.*
